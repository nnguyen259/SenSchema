      Effects are applied to items (weapons, armor, shoes, accessories, consumables, quartzes) or magic (art, crafts, brave orders).
      
      Most effect types are ignored in some circumstances, for example:
      - Effect 1 (Strength-based physical damage) works on consumable items used in battle, but not from the out-of-battle menu.
      - Effect 206 (Crit chance) works for accessories, but not for crafts (despite their descriptions).
      - Effect 223 (Chrono Burst) only works when applied to magic, but not when applied to an item.
      - Effect 330 (Domination) only works when applied to a quartz, but not when applied to an accessory.
      
      For most effect types, one or more data values are used to determine the exact effect.
      
      For effects that inflict status ailments:
      - The first data value is the activation chance in percent (before target resistance).
        If the value is 1000, target resistance is ignored and the effect is guaranteed to take effect.
      - The second data value is the number of turns.
        If the value is zero, a fallback value will be used (depends on ailment).
      Status ailment effect generally work when applied to magic or consumables (only in battle).
      When applied to accessories, affects the target of attacks.
      
      For effects that inflict stat buffs and debuffs:
      - The first data value is the added/subtracted amount in percent.
        The value 999991 describes an (S) buff/debuff (±15%).
        The value 999992 describes an (M) buff/debuff (±30%).
        The value 999993 describes an (L) buff/debuff (±45%).
      - The second value is the number of turns.
      - The third value is the chance in percent (before target resistance, only for debuffs).
      Buffs and debuffs generally work when applied to magic or consumables (only in battle).
      When applied to accessories, affects the target of attacks.
      
      Effects that cure a status ailment or debuff generally don't use any data value.
      They work when applied to magic or consumables (in battle).
      When applied to accessories, they affect the target of attacks.
